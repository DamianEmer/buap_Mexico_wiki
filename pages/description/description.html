                <p>Recently the Puebla’s government approved a law to ban the use of plastics package as part of several
                    action
                    to decrease the negative impact caused by this material. On the other hand, Mexico city (cdmx)
                    registered
                    the highest air pollution levels in the last ten years, leading an environmental crisis which affects
                    states
                    around cdmx like Puebla, guerrero, tlaxcala and morelos. At first sight, this phenomena had a negative
                    impact just in people living in this cities, however, based on this situation we decided to look for
                    more
                    information about the indirect effects on the environment and living organisms. Then, we noticed that we
                    just saw the tip of the iceberg and this phenomenon has so many negative impacts but we had special
                    interest
                    in the ocean acidification which is one of the most unstudied and perhaps will be the most dangerous for
                    the
                    marine environment in the future. Then, as students of the faculty of Biological Sciences of the BUAP we
                    decided to try to solve this problem and we looked for different projects that would be related and we
                    found
                    a lot of interesting ideas, but the most remarkable were the project from NCKU Tainan and UESTC-China,
                    they
                    motivated us to try to solve this potentially dangerous problem at the same that we would be able to
                    produce
                    a beneficial material from this process. In our case we decided to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)
                    from
                    the molecule causing the ocean acidification, the CO2.
                    PHB might be used like a substitute of the plastic polymer, and it has the benefit to be biodegradable
                    and
                    ecofriendly, supporting in this way the government's efforts to avoid the use of plastic.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Nowadays the excessive production of CO₂ is causing a phenomenon called ocean acidification (OA) which
                    combined with tons of plastics in the ocean are both main problems in the marine environment. Through
                    genetically transformation, E. coli BL-21 bacterium will combine the capability of plants to get CO₂
                    from the marine environment (decreasing the OA) and the skill from some bacterium to degradate of
                    vegetable waste in order to have sugar source. Both processes are vital in order to produce great
                    pyruvate quantities to get polyhydroxybutyrate, which is used to produce bioplastics that could replace
                    the prevailing polymer . For maintaining the Pyruvate production and photorespiration in the highest and
                    lowest level, respectively we will design a system which works under anaerobic conditions and repress
                    the aerobic metabolism using arcA protein and for measuring the pyruvate production we design a
                    biosensor.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        The greenhouse effect, produce by gases like CO₂, CH4, NxO, ozone, and water vapor, is a phenomenon
                        that
                        allows to maintain life as we know it, since if it does not exist, the average of temperature of the
                        Earth
                        will be -19°C approximately. This effect has been in equilibrium, since the earth, by itself, has
                        biotic
                        and
                        abiotic mechanisms that allows decrease the amount atmospheric of these gases. On the biological
                        side,
                        we
                        have that CO₂ plays a very important role in the ecosystems of the planet since, it is a metabolite
                        produced
                        by the most living beings as a secondary product of cellular respiration. On the other hand, it is
                        the
                        primary source of carbon for the production of sugars in photosynthesis. On the abiotic side, we
                        have
                        that
                        the water bodies, specially oceans are capable to assimilate this gas, thereby reducing the
                        atmospheric
                        concentration and facilitating the access of marine organisms to this source.

                    However, since the beginning of industrial revolution, the use of machines that emit greenhouse gases
                    increased significantly, this in combination with high rate of deforestation, which deprives the planet
                    of its main terrestrial filters, has caused the concentration of atmospheric CO₂ pass through dramatic
                    increases, since before this time, it has a range between 280 to 385 ppm and at the end of the 20th
                    century it was estimated a range of 700 to 1000 ppm.
                </div>
    
                <div class="container-paragraph paragraph-3">
                    There is a growing scientific evidence that high absorption of CO₂ by the oceans, has occasioned an
                    important increase in the average oceanic acidity in comparison with pre-industrial levels. According to
                    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), continued CO₂ emissions in line with current trends,
                    could make the oceans up to 150% more acidic in 2100 than they were at the beginning of the
                    Anthropocene.
                    The CO2 that has been diffused in the water, reacts in the following way:
    
                </div>
    
                <div class="container-paragraph paragraph-4">
                    <div class="formulate">H_2 O+CO_2↔H_2 〖CO〗_3↔ 〖HCO〗_3^-+H^+</div>
    
                    The free hydrogen proton can react with the carbonate ion to produce bicarbonate
    
                    <div class="formulate">H^++〖CO〗_3^(2-)↔ 〖HCO〗_3^-</div>
                </div>
    
                <div class="container-paragraph paragraph-5">
                    This reaction has profound impacts on biologic systems, since bicarbonate is considered a building block
                    in the species calcification process, so a reduction in carbonate pool limits the growth of these
                    organisms. With a reduce size the amount of food decreases and therefore the food-web is affected with
                    the reduction of organisms of most aquatic species, that includes species of commercial value for human
                    society and therefore ends up impacting in the economy.

                <div class="container-paragraph paragraph-6">
                    Protons that do not react with free carbonate cause that pH of the medium to decrease and it has
                    estimated that last 20 years the reduction is 0.1 pH units which can interpreted as a 26% increase water
                    acidity. Carbonate ions are a basic building block of skeletons and shells for a large number of marine
                    organisms including corals, seafood and marine plankton. Some of this smaller calcifying plankton are
                    important source of food for higher marine organisms. Therefore, ocean acidification could have profound
                    impacts in some of the most fundamental biological and geochemical processes of the sea in the coming
                    decades.

                    It is estimated that if the emission rate of this gas continues in this way, by the end of the century
                    the acidity of the seas will have increased by 150%, levels that have not been experienced for more than
                    20 million years.

                    In addition, acidification decreases the ability of ocean to absorb additional atmospheric CO₂, which
                    implies that future CO₂ emissions lead to faster global warming, it is estimated that ocean absorb
                    around 430 billion tons of atmospheric CO₂ or approximately a third of anthropogenic carbon emissions.
                    This absorption has benefited humanity by reduce significantly the levels of greenhouses gases in
                    atmosphere, thereby minimizing global warming.

                    On the other hand, at the beginning of the years nobody imagined that plastic, which was supposed to be
                    of great help for the development of human society given the versatility it possesses and therefore the
                    variety of applications it can have, would have an opposite effect counterproductive in the environment,
                    since in recent years the increase in the production of these synthetic polymers derived from petroleum
                    has profoundly impacted the marine environment and the different species that inhabit it. The excessive
                    production and poor regulation with this material has been such that the most dramatic case known is the
                    new continent of garbage located in the Pacific Ocean, which is mainly composed of plastic. The main
                    problem with these materials, in addition to the little regulation that exists in their production, is
                    that they are petroleum-derived polymers that are chemically modified to obtain some characteristic of
                    interest, so they have different properties from the polymers found in nature (such as cellulose,
                    chitin, glycogen, etc.), this results in the degradation by microorganisms is very slow prolonging their
                    life in the environment which leads to their accumulation. In Mexico, the annual consumption of plastics
                    per inhabitant in 2005 was estimated at 49 kilograms. Of the total consumed, more than one million tons
                    per year become waste. The presence of these plastics in the seas is variable, but there are reports of
                    abundance of 3 to 5 kg/km^2, With records of up 30kg/km^2. in addition to this, the recycling rate is
                    very low since of the 300 million tons produced annually in the country, only 3 % are recycled.

                        Good regulation standards are necessary to help in the conservation of environment, however,
                        removing
                        plastic from our daily lives would seem an almost impossible task since it has permeated different
                        social, economic and even cultural levels, so is important to search alternatives.
