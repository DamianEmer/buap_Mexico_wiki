                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Since June, we collaborated with a team from the north of mexico, UAAAN. One of our team members
                        received a friend request of their team leader and we made some video calls to share our projects
                        and get a feedback about how to built biobricks and their components.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        We both are beginners teams and we had some doubts that were solved through several video calls,
                        however, the most remarkable situation was that they had some troubles about their wiki. In our team
                        we had members with a lot of experience in the design of websites field,then we decided to do
                        several webinars with UAAAN to give them some lessons about how to upload their information, wiki
                        style design and how to organize information in a web site.

                        On September we had the pleasure to collaborate with team Tec-Chihuahua in two different activities:
                        our documentary about women in science and the development of their Education Manual.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        A video meeting was held with the team on September 5th to discuss each others projects and
                        advances, especially in the Human Practices part. This section drew our attention, so we decided to
                        collaborate with the two different dynamics of our teams in the Human Practices.

                        from kindergarten to talk about science and introduce them to this wonderful world. The
                        Tec-Chihuahua team was working on an Education Manual: they were implementing strategies and visits
                        for different levels of education less the kindergarten, so, we helped them to obtained information
                        and strategies for this particular level from our planning and activities focused at this level.

                        Also, their team helped collecting information for our women in science documentary and research,
                        they interviewed five different female scientists and obtained information that we needed and
                        requested to elaborate this Human Practices. Their interviews helped us to collect information about
                        this particular situation and to propose and raise a proposal for the situation of the women.

                        A project which valuate a bigger sample is better than other that works with little populations, so,
                        in order to have more data about science woman in other states we also collaborated with UANL.

                    <div class="paragraph">Several video conferences allow us exchange ideas about our projects and identify
                        some theoretical points that we could improve. Also, it helped us to define the goals of our
                        collaboration, the data collection about scientific women.

                        For human practices, they helped us collecting information about the situacion of scientist woman.
                        To do this, they interviewed different female scientists getting information that allow us
                        understand the existing differences and similarities in the scientific community in both states.
                        Their information helped us to make the first step to review the legislation about the women
