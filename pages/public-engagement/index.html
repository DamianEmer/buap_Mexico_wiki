                <p>
                    Our commitment to society was fundamental for our team, because we are sure that if people know more
                    about the problems that science tries to solve, they will want to get involved, apart from the fact
                    that we consider not only to leave work in a laboratory, it is important to transmit that new
                    information; therefore, our team tried to involve society through various activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that between science and society there is a point that makes them converge, disclosure,
                    without it both would exist in a vacuum of ideas and problems; That is why we seek to impact with
                    information and proposals, thanks to this we obtained a constant feedback in which we were able to
                    learn bidirectionally.

                    Our project is in direct contact with the existence of pollution caused by plastic. Since this
                    direct relationship exists we have thought about how important it is, as a society to have a culture
                    of separation and recycling, in this way to put our grain of sand by decreasing the contamination by
                    this material, either by collecting and recycling together with organizations and companies in
                    charge of their collection and treatment or individually in our home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is how we joined companies with social responsibility such as GREEN CARSON. The Green Carson
                    company is a company in charge of waste collection and management, it is the best solution in waste
                    collection, treatment and final disposal focused on companies, industries, government entities and
                    municipalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We joined with Green Carson to seek the same objective; promote the culture of recycling, this was
                    achieved through conferences held at our University on Monday, August 29, 2019.where the problem of
                    plastic was addressed through raw figures as well as its impact on ecosystems on land and sea, to
                    later explain the importance of separation and recycling PET, the ways to classify it, as well as
                    the role we have as an individual and society to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the talk, several of the students involved expressed ideas of projects that could be
                    carried out for the reduction of PET and its use. This reinforces how important it is to inform
                    students about current issues and work on solutions within their reach, in addition to the positive
                    feedback that the company and team representatives received.

                    We are convinced that children represent our future as a country; If we help cultivate interest in
                    science, these children will grow up without gaps in information about it. That is why this category
                    is divided into classes, workshops and a videogame that they developed to understand the problems we
                    address within the project.

                <p>
                    Synthetic biology is a weird concept in many schools in Puebla, we decided to make several visits to
                    middle and high school institutions to share with children what is the positive impact of synthetic
                    biology and the develop of this field in recent years. In order to have better communication with
                    guys we receive support by a licentiate in education to structure our program.
                </p>
                <p>After we received some advices, we divided our program in it in two parts: Concepts and Activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A concept class need to be short (around 20 minutes) and as familiars as possible, we did not use a
                    lot of technicism and we replaced some concepts for other more familiar, for instance genes for Lego
                    pieces, with this strategy we got the attention of the groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For activities we played some games in order to feedback the new concepts they learned such as
                    synthetic biology, biobricks, genes, and much more. These games were adaptations of Mexican games as
                    “encantados” and “policias y ladrones”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We received a good response by children, and they learn a lot of new terms in an easy way.

                <h3 id="workshops">Workshops "Living the science"</h3>
                <p>
                    Our team, with the support of the city council of the city of Córdoba, Veracruz, organized Science
                    Workshops with a reach for people of all ages. These 3 workshops consisted of a workshop on
                    Scientific Illustration, Science Workshops and a talk about Women in Science, which had a deep and
                    direct relationship with our human practices on Women in Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These workshops were held at the City Municipal Library on August 30 and 31, September 7 and 8, and
                    September 21 and 22.
                </p>

                <h4 id="SIW">1.- Scientific Illustration Workshop</h4>
                <p class="centrado"><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>
                    The illustration has been applied in science since ancient times, to represent the discoveries to
                    the public, inside and outside the scientific field. This need to disseminate information is still
                    present today through photography, 3D modeling, and digital drawing focused on science. That is why,
                    the scientific illustration workshop is proposed, since it allows the attendees to understand in a
                    practical way, the need to not only produce science in the laboratory or the field, but to make it
                    accessible and open to the public.
                </p>

                <p class="centrado"><b>Objective</b></p>

                    <li>
                        Final exercise: Plant species were presented to the attendees, along with their anatomical
                        descriptions. From them they made silhouettes, sketches and an illustration of the species
                        highlighting the key parts according to the description.
                    </li>

                <p class="centrado"><b>Observations and comments</b></p>
                <p>
                    Some attendees had good theoretical and practical knowledge about the management of color applied to
                    watercolor, this facilitated the progress of the workshop and allowed more time for observation
                    exercises and to see applications of scientific drawing. It was very gratifying to see the interest
                    of the attendees and that our PlastiCO2 project was a close and done example in our region. This
                    workshop allowed attendees to understand that the applications of drawing are not limited to
                    entertainment or advertising design, but that it has been and continues to be an important pillar
                    for scientific dissemination.

                <h4 id="WIS">2.- Women in Science</h4>
                <p class="centrado"><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>
                    During the time in which we approach surveys and interviews within our integrated human practices
                    for women in science, we realize that the main factor by which girls lose interest in science is by
                    the family nucleus, that is; The parents' opinion about science and related careers is how we
                    understood that not only was the dissemination of science at different educational levels important,
                    but also to fathers and mothers. We know that we cannot impose a position on science, because people
                    are free to give a different opinion; However, we believe it is important to disseminate true
                    information about the subject, so that people can opt for a solid position with basic information.
                    This is how the discussion of women in science emerged, elaborated in order to eliminate the
                    stereotypes that Mexican culture has formed over decades about gender roles within science.
                </p>

                <p class="centrado"><b>Objectives</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eradicate stereotypes of gender roles within the scientific field.</li>
                    <li>
                        Stimulate the scientific vocations of children and young people regardless of gender
                        stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contribute to the perspective of society so that they can generate actions towards gender equity
                        in science.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make known the contribution and contributions of women to science.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="centrado"><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>
                    The talk began with examples of outstanding women within the scientific field with their respective
                    contributions, after that figures from the AMC (Mexican Academy of Sciences) and CONACYT (Council of
                    Science and Technology) on the subject were provided; this with the objective of visualizing the
                    great difference between women and men that develop within the area, comparing this figure with
                    other countries of Latin America and later with countries around the world, then a video about
                    interviews with doctors about the theme and perspective of each of them, the figures we obtained
                    through the surveys we conducted were also explained, to finally explain
                </p>

                <p class="centrado"><b>Observations and comments</b></p>
                <p>
                    We consider that it was a unique experience to be able to carry out this talk on the subject in
                    which
                    we immersed ourselves for several months, for us it was very important the assistance of fathers and
                    mothers in which we could observe a lot of participation through questions. We undoubtedly believe
                    that it is very important to continue the dissemination of this information with the aim of
                    eliminating erroneous ideologies about women in science and promoting their participation and
                    interest in it.

                <p class="centrado"><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>
                    Many times educational centers lack teaching materials and personnel to prepare and conduct
                    experimental activities or educational workshops. These limitations make classes become expository,
                    with little or no participation of students and the use of laboratories is restricted. That is why
                    we decided to go beyond the theory, thus planning the science workshop, it was developed so that
                    people of all ages could have direct contact with science. Our team knows that manipulating,
                    experimenting and showing science in its real context fosters the desire to know and be partakers of
                    the scientific world. In addition, it encourages adopting a positive attitude towards science while
                    encouraging the development of skills related to the way of doing science, such as observation,
                    question and prediction, Interpretation of results, etc.

                    The workshop was opened through basic experiments of different sciences, in order to capture
                    everyone's attention, after that they followed some experiments about DNA, for example the
                    extraction of DNA with fruits such as strawberries, bananas and tomatoes; the principles of each
                    experiment were explained to them while they were carried out with the participation of everyone and
                    after that they were told about the applications of this knowledge, all this was necessary to land
                    on the subject of synthetic biology, where they were explained what it was and how our team worked
                    to solve environmental problems such as water acidification and plastic pollution.

                <p class="centrado"><b>Observations and comments</b></p>
                <p>
                    It was quite satisfying to notice the children's interest in the experiments performed, see their
                    curiosity and be able to answer their questions; after this activity we have no doubt that children
                    generate the best questions; Well, your curiosity is present all the time. It was also comforting to
                    see the participation of adults as well as their surprise to understand why some phenomena happen
                    that until then they did not fully understand or had not even questioned.

                <p class="centrado"><b>Education from Video Games</b></p>
                <p>
                    In the current system of educational competencies that the SEP asks teachers, it is not enough that
                    the student only memorize terms, dates, equations and data in general. This knowledge needs to be
                    processed and improved, that is, one must understand and associate them in different fields, in
                    order to apply it in a problem or new area of opportunity. That is why in our science and math
                    studies we discover new areas and topics such as electromechanics, bioethics or astrophysics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This, together with raising interest in the syllabus, are the objectives of the educator in the
                    curriculum, as the student has to raise their knowledge beyond what is seen in the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For learning, students can be approximated by different senses, such as visual, auditory and
                    kinesthetic, with which they explore their environment and their understanding of the sciences and
                    philosophy of the human being. Each student responds with different degrees of effectiveness
                    depending on their predisposition, consequently, the teacher has to use different tools to capture
                    the student's attention and facilitate a personalized teaching. Exercises such as dictation,
                    elaborate and examine illustrations, reading and summaries, among others, are common activities that
                    educators use for understanding and information processing. And yet, modern education often ignores
                    a set of tools that cover all the senses of the human being for learning in a single medium, as well
                    as being flashy and fun for students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is the reason by we decided to apply a survey to students of middle school, to verify how they
                    really get certain scientific knowledge that can be, in a way, difficult to explain for teachers. As
                    well as knowing how students prefer get knowledge about this area.
                </p>

                <p><b><i>Education accompanied with digital tools.</i></b></p>

                <p>
                    The teacher often thinks that these means are a substitution that is naturally from one method to
                    another "better", a book by Wikipedia. The assumption will be made that articles and digital books
                    replaced physical versions in libraries, since today's students are more instructed to investigate
                    using the internet. However, these are totally different means, which have different strengths and
                    weaknesses. For example, on the internet you will find the full biography of Hernán Cortes more
                    easily, while in a university thesis you can have specialized research on the psyche of the
                    conqueror of America. Greater ease in finding content, against specialization of information,
                    difficulty in verifying data, backups and sources, against less scope and slow distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The educator must understand that, despite having certain similar characteristics (such as content
                    and information), they should be used in different instances. And so, like the didactic or
                    illustrative material that can help to understand the topics of the class, these can be confusing
                    and ineffective if they are not used in the right way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all research, we have a a question, how do students really prefer to obtain this information?
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the results obtained from the applied surveys, we got the follow graph which indicate
                    that children would prefer to learn science through video games more than books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, the conception of videogames as an educational tool is neglected, seen merely as a
                    distractor and not a facilitator for learning. In addition to that the designers and creators of
                    this tool do not understand its potential, limitations and disadvantages, being poorly designed at
                    several points, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Break the immersion and cause disinterest, by saturating information with long texts. Why use a
                        video game when you can read all that in a book? This should be distributed and summarized along
                        the way, to avoid being tedious and boring. Knowing how to distribute the information is key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lack of user interaction, as well as uninteresting mechanics, loses the kinesthetic part of
                        student learning. Why use a videogame then, when removing user participation maintains an equal
                        product? You should not lose sight of the fact that it should also be interesting to play it, as
                        this is not an interactive book or documentary, and should not be treated as such.
                        <p>
                            Digitizing an analog game (such as a puzzle or memory) is extremely expensive and
                            inefficient. It is easier to use or create a physical version.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The video game must be a tool for introducing knowledge (or in any case, a summary of them) and
                        a generator of interest, rather than the substituent of some material. The videogame has the
                        problem of reducing information, to avoid the first point, hindering a complete panorama of the
                        subject. However, the impact that the student has with the key points presented to him is
                        stronger and more lasting than with any other form of teaching.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With all this in mind, the game "Coli" is intended as a key teaching, for certain complicated
                    elements of the agenda of this project for the iGEM, rather than being an encyclopedia of varied
                    knowledge to understand biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, it is designed for minds of secondary, elementary school, who have basic concepts of
                    biology, to understand the game.
